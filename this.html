	 * ... and so, the value of the 'bar' property of the sayBar() function is determined
	 * by scope of the function, NOT by the way (context) in which the function is called.
	 * The scope of the function is determined by where the function was DEFINED, which 
	 * means that the value of 'bar' is the value of 'window.bar' because sayBar() was
	 * defined in the global (window) namespace.
