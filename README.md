========

These are some very loosely organized experiments, for the purpose of impoving my understanding

Here's an equally loose index of what can be viewed online:

Koch Snowflake[http://uni-sol.ca/js-demos/kochflake.html] (based on example code from 'Canvas Pocket Reference' by Flanagan, 2011)

MOV16[http://uni-sol.ca/js-demos/mov16.html] (output show up in console; an emulation of a assembly MOV opperation on a 16-bit microprocessor)
