========

These are some very loosely organized experiments, for the purpose of improving my understanding.

Here's an equally loose index of what can be viewed online:


[FFT Simple ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/fft-simple.html)
(first try at music visualization using pre-analyzed fft data)

[FFT More ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/fft.html)
(continues exploration of music visualization using pre-analyzed fft data)

[Visualizer (+input) ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/visualizer.html)
(continues exploration of music visualization, adding mouse interaction)

[Koch Snowflake ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/kochflake.html)
(expansion of example from 'Canvas Pocket Reference' by D. Flanagan, 2011)

[Gradient ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/gradient.html)
(Gradient example converted to Canvas API from [Processing API](http://processing.org/examples/lineargradient.html) )

[MOV16 ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/mov16.html)
(output shows up in console; an emulation of an assembly MOV opperation on a 16-bit microprocessor)

[Range2 Class ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/class.html)
(based on example from 'JavaScript Pocket Reference' by D. Flanagan, 2012)

[Try 'this' ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/this.html)
(comparing use of 'this' v.s. vars within methods; partially based on code from 'JavaScript Enlightenment' by C. Lindley, 2012)


[Stylogical Maps ](http://www.real-currents.com/js-demos/stymaps/intro.005.html)
(these demos were my first efforts with HTML5 Canvas, initially using the Processing.js API. Later demos in the series use direct calls to the Canvas API)
