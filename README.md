========

These are some very loosely organized experiments, for the purpose of improving my understanding.

Here's an equally loose index of what can be viewed online:


[FFT Simple ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/fft-simple.html) 
(first try at music visualization using pre-analyzed fft data)

[FFT More ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/fft.html) 
(continues exploration of music visualization using pre-analyzed fft data)

[Visualizer (+input) ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/visualizer.html)
(continues exploration of music visualization, adding mouse interaction)

[Visualizer (+VIDEO) ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/happy-b-day.html)
(continues exploration of music visualization, adding real-time compositing of HTML5 video)

[Koch Snowflake ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/kochflake.html) 
(expansion of example from 'Canvas Pocket Reference' by D. Flanagan, 2011)

[Gradient ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/gradient.html) 
(Gradient example converted to Canvas API from [Processing API](http://processing.org/examples/lineargradient.html) )

[MOV16 ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/mov16.html) 
(output shows up in console; an emulation of an assembly MOV opperation on a 16-bit microprocessor) 

[Range2 Class ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/class.html) 
(based on example from 'JavaScript Pocket Reference' by D. Flanagan, 2012)

[Try 'this' ](http://uni-sol.org/js-demos/this.html) 
(comparing use of 'this' v.s. vars within methods; partially based on code from 'JavaScript Enlightenment' by C. Lindley, 2012)


Stylogical Maps 
(these demos were my first efforts with HTML5 Canvas, initially using the Processing.js API. Later demos in the series use direct calls to the Canvas API)
