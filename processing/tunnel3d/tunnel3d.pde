/* tunnel3d
 *
 * This sketch is based on "3d Tunnel in 200 Bytes"
 * by Luis Gonzales (http://openprocessing.org/sketch/3621)
 * 'tunnel3d.pde' is a place holder within the Processing
 * IDE, which displays this comment and imports the libs
 * necessary for running this sketch in Processing.
 * 'tunnel3d.java' is the working code which can either
 * be run in Processing or compiled with javac to create
 * 'tunnel3d.class'. The class file can then be executed
 * from the containing directory, with the command line:
 * 
 * > "java -cp '.;../lib/core.jar;' tunnel3d tunnel3d"
 *
 * where "../lib/core.jar" is the path to the core lib for
 * Processing 2.0(+). 
 * Obviously the java file is now bigger than 200bytes. 
 * This has become an exploration of the mathematical
 * techniques used to build the illusion of a 3d tunnel
 * projected onto a 2d screen. I'm looking into reproducing
 * this illusion using gradients with a vector drawing
 * method, rather than in the pixel/raster method that is 
 * currently used. I believe this sketch is inspired by
 * similar raster methods historically used in the
 * demoscene.
